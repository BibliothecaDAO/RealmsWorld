Schedule yourself an armor fitting, my lord, Eternum is coming at you with sword swinging.  Ready for battle? We invite you to join us for *OktoberTest*.

## **What is the Eternum OktoberTest?**

A raucous celebration of life and death in Eternum, washed down with ale, served with good company.

Play the latest version of Eternum and [banter with the Lords of the Realms community](https://discord.gg/realmsworld) this October.&nbsp; There are streams, player challenges, community events - including game design briefings, economic reviews,&nbsp; play-alongs with the game‚Äôs developers - and the chance to earn a little beer money.

Sounds like a bit of you? Head to the [discord](https://discord.gg/realmsworld).

You do not need to be a Realm owner to play in the Eternum *OktoberTest*.&nbsp; You will be assigned a Realm when you first [play](https://eternum.realms.world/). The OktoberTest of Eternum takes place on a free-to-use testnet and there are zero in-game wallet transactions thanks to the [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg/) Controller.&nbsp; Let‚Äôs raise a toast to frictionless UX!

**What type of game is Eternum?**

Eternum is a real time strategy MMO that will feel familiar to those who have played other strategy games.&nbsp; You will understand the game and be up and running quickly.

What we set to experience together is how a competitive multiplayer grand strategy game plays out when it is running on an open network. Anyone can make a prediction about how players will act, but it can't be know what will truly happen until the game is in production.

There is a wildness to a blockchain-based game that cannot be compared to one running on a publisher‚Äôs centrally administered server. We expect players to push the boundaries of this mercurial world ‚Äî and expand it ‚Äî in ways no one has yet imagined for a strategy game, writing stories onchain, imperishably, and forever.

Read about the fully onchain game, [Eternum](https://eternum.realms.world/), [here](https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/world-guide/blob/main/realms-world-guide-v1.0.0.pdf) and [here](https://realms.world/games/realms-eternum).&nbsp;

## **What‚Äôs the goal of OktoberTest?**

*OktoberTest* will ease you into the new world. You will learn about the game from devs and other players, compete in a low stakes environment, develop allies and enemies - toasting both with a beer in the Fool & Flintlock, the Realms pub, which will be open day and night in the discord.

[Playtesting](https://eternum.realms.world/) is the best way to improve Eternum.  Get into the world and start exploring.  Playing, and giving feedback, will speed up the hunt for a release candidate of the game. And its OktoberTest, so lets have fun doing it üçª

## **OktoberTest Schedule**&nbsp;

We will post weekly schedules and pop up play sessions here and in the discord.&nbsp;Over the opening days it will be low key streaming sessions - drop in, or stream your own game play.

Events to be announced will include game design briefings and social play sessions.&nbsp; There will be pop-up challenges with rewards. Players are encouraged to stream their gameplay in the discord, or join other Lords playing.

Most events take place in [Discord](https://discord.gg/realsmworld). It‚Äôs OktoberTest, so please bring your own stein, ml.&nbsp;
