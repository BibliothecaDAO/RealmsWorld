Schedule yourself an armor fitting, my lord, Eternum is coming out swinging. We invite you to join us for OktoberTest.  Eternum spawns fantasy worlds at the bleeding edge.&nbsp;

## **What is the Eternum OktoberTest?**

Play the latest version of Eternum and [join the Realms community](https://discord.gg/realmsworld) over October.&nbsp; There are streams, player challenges, community events - including game design briefings, economic reviews,&nbsp; play-alongs with the game‚Äôs developers - and the chance to earn a little beer money. Head to the [discord](https://discord.gg/realmsworld).

You do not need to be a Realm owner to play in the Eternum OktoberTest.&nbsp; You will be assigned a Realm when you first play. The OktoberTest of Eternum takes place on a free-to-use testnet and there are zero in-game wallet transactions thanks to the [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg/) Controller.&nbsp; Let‚Äôs raise a drink to frictionless UX!

**What type of game is Eternum?**

Eternum is a real time strategy MMO that will feel familiar to those who have played other strategy games.&nbsp; You will understand the game and be up and running quickly.

What we set to experience together is how a competitive multiplayer grand strategy game plays out when it is running on an open network.

There is a wildness to a blockchain-based game that cannot be compared to one running on a publisher‚Äôs centrally administered server. We expect players to push the boundaries of this mercurial world ‚Äî and expand it ‚Äî in ways no one has yet imagined for a strategy game, writing stories onchain, imperishably, and forever.

Read about the fully onchain game, Eternum, [here](https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/world-guide/blob/main/realms-world-guide-v1.0.0.pdf) and [here](https://realms.world/games/realms-eternum).&nbsp;

## **What‚Äôs the goal of OktoberTest?**

OktoberTest will ease you into the new world. You will learn about the game from devs and other players, compete in a low stakes environment, develop allies and enemies - toasting both with a beer in the Fool & Flintlock which will be open day and night in the discord.

Playtesting is the best way to improve Eternum.  Get into the world and start exploring.  Playing, and giving feedback, will speed up the hunt for a release candidate of the game. And its OktoberTest, so lets have fun doing it üçª

## **OktoberTest Schedule**&nbsp;

We will post weekly schedules and pop up play sessions here and in the discord.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Events include game design briefings and social play sessions.&nbsp; There will be pop-up challenges with rewards. Players are encouraged to stream their gameplay in the discord, or join other Lords playing.

Most events take place in [Discord](https://discord.gg/realsmworld). It‚Äôs OktoberTest, so please bring your own stein, ml.&nbsp;
