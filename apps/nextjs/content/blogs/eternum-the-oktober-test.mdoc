My Lord, schedule yourself an armor fitting—Eternum is coming out swinging. First OktoberTest, then the Mainnet Preview. Prepare to make landfall in Eternum with this guide.

**What is the Eternum OktoberTest?**

Play the latest version of Eternum and join the Realms community over October.&nbsp; There are player challenges, community events - including game design briefings, economic reviews,&nbsp; play-alongs with the game’s developers - and the chance to earn a little beer money.

You do not need to be a Realm owner to play in the Eternum OktoberTest.&nbsp; You will be assigned a Realm when you first play. The OktoberTest of Eternum takes place on a free-to-use testnet and there are zero in-game wallet transactions thanks to the [Cartridge](https://cartridge.gg/) Controller.&nbsp; Let’s raise a drink to frictionless UX!

**What type of game is Eternum?**

Eternum is a real time strategy MMO that will feel familiar to those who have played other strategy games.&nbsp; You will understand the game and be up and running quickly.

What we are all set to experience together is how a competitive multiplayer grand strategy game plays out when it is running on an open network.&nbsp;

There is a wildness to a blockchain-based game that cannot be compared to one running on a publisher’s centrally administered server. We expect players to push the boundaries of this mercurial world—and expand it—in ways no one has yet imagined for a strategy game, writing stories onchain, imperishably, and forever.

Read about the fully onchain game, Eternum, [here](https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/world-guide/blob/main/realms-world-guide-v1.0.0.pdf) and [here](https://realms.world/games/realms-eternum).&nbsp;

**What’s the goal of OktoberTest?**

OktoberTest will ease you into the new world. You will learn about the game from devs and other players, compete in a low stakes environment, develop allies and enemies - toasting both with a beer.

Following OktoberTest is the Eternum *Mainnet Preview.* Prepare yourself, my Lord, for your victories and defeats to settle on Ethereum via Starknet in a high-stakes environment.

In the *Mainnet Preview* Lords will be taking residence in their owned Realm, surveying surrounding geography,&nbsp; directing their economy, military and diplomacy efforts - and seeking to make their mark. $Lords will flow around the economy and [the Lordship Protocol.](https://realms.world/blogs/the-lordship-protocol)

So please consider OktoberTest as the best way to prepare yourself for the mercurial brutality of Eternum mainnet.

**OktoberTest Schedule**&nbsp;

We will post weekly schedules and pop up play sessions here and in the discord.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Events will include game design briefings and social play sessions.&nbsp; There will be challenges and rewards, and undoubtedly the astute Lords will be seeking alpha to carry into the Mainnet Preview.&nbsp;

Most events take place in Discord. It’s OktoberTest, so please bring your own stein, ml.&nbsp;
