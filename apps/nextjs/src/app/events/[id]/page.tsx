            Built on Starknet and powered by Dojo - pave your way to victory in
            an onchain strategy game like no other.

          <h3>There is a 2,500 $Lords tournament</h3>
          <p>
            The player with the best score will be the tournament&apos;s Lord of
            the Board. There are nine prizes to be won by players.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>⚒️ First place: 1000 $Lords - aka Lord of the Board</li>
            <li>⚒️ Second place: 500 $Lords</li>
            <li>⚒️ Third place: 300 $Lords</li>
            <li>⚒️ Fastest game in the top 10: 200 $Lords</li>
            <li>⚒️ 5 randomly selected players: 100 $Lords</li>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>
            In the single player mode, the player has 72 tiles to lay and score
            as many points as possible in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            As tiles are laid, Cities, Roads, Wonders & Forests are formed and
            developed. Placing your Characters on these tiles gives you the
            opportunity to accumulate points - scored when structures are
            completed.
